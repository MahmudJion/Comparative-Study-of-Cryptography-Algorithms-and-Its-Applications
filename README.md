In modern world, security is the most valuable term in the field of communication system. Security comes
along with many technologies and methods, where one of the most secure technologies is Cryptography
where ordinary plain text is converted into cipher text for transferring data to the valid user. Cryptography
algorithms can be divided into two types based on the number of keys such as Symmetric and Asymmetric
where Symmetric algorithm works with one single key and Asymmetric algorithm works with two different
keys. However, selecting the appropriate algorithms for specific application has been always a challenging
task because of the latency, key size, and security issues. Cryptographic algorithms face different type of
attacks like brute force attack, man in the middle attack, cycle attacks etc., which are still remained as
threads. This paper presents the performance analysis, based on different performance metrics and threads,
of various techniques of cryptographic algorithms and identifies the suitable algorithms for different types
of applications.
